      <h2 id="easy">It has never been easier to build your own framework</h2>
      <p>
        Building a framework like Next.js used to be hard. These days are over: with modern tools, such as Vite, you can
        build your own Next.js with only hundreds of lines of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't let a framework dictate your architecture, keep full control, and use any tool and technology you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        Build internal company frameworks to scale your teams, or delight your users with a bespoke framework, or just
        keep architectural control.
      </p>
      <p>Build Your Own Framework.</p>

      <h2 id="all-included">All-included frameworks</h2>
      <p>
        While frameworks like Next.js only take care of the frontend, you can build a framework that includes
        everything: the server (Express.js, Koa, ...), authentication, API (GraphQL, RPC, ...), ORM (Prisma, MikroORM,
        ...), logging (e.g. Prometheus), error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag, ...), emailing (e.g. Mailgun + Nodemailer),
        deployment (AWS, Cloudflare Workers, ...).
      </p>
      <p>
        All your framework's users have left to do is: define UI components and data models (if your framework has a
        database).
      </p>

      <h2 id="scale">Build company internal frameworks, to scale your teams</h2>
      <p>
        Give senior employees the power of fully owning the architecture while providing junior employees an
        <a href="#all-included">all-included framework</a> that takes care of everything.
      </p>
      <p>Keep full control and leverage your company's favorite tools without limitations nor compromise.</p>
      <p>
        You can then share (some of) your internal frameworks with the world, fostering open source values within your
        company while stimulating and attracting engineering talent. For example, Facebook's decision to open source and
        share React with the world has been a strong force inside Facebook for engineering excellence and has enabled
        Facebook to hire highly skilled Software Engineers.
      </p>

      <h2 id="framework-as-a-product">Build a framework tailored to your product, to delight your users</h2>
      <p>Delight your users with a bespoke framework that deeply integrates with your product.</p>
      <p>
        For example, if you are a headless CMS provider (Sanity, Contentful, Tina, ...), then build a CMS on top. Or, if
        you are a full-stack deployment provider (PlanetScale, Cloudflare D1, Fly, ...), then build a thin full-stack
        framework to showcase the capabalities of your deployment platform and for the community to fork. Or, if you are
        an e-commerce platform, provide a framework like Shopify's
        <a href="https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/">Hydrogen</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Build a "Framework as a Product".</p>

      <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
      <p>Vike is just a website (this website) recommending you to build your own framework.</p>
      <p>Following tools can be used to build frameworks.</p>
      <ul id="tool-list">
        <li>
          <a href="https://vitejs.dev">Vite</a> - Next Generation Frontend Tooling.
          <blockquote>
            <p>Vite is a webpack alternative that has first-class support for building frameworks.</p>
            <p>
              In particular, check out <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html">Vite's native SSR API</a> which is a
              low-level and highly flexible API enabling you to build SSR frameworks.
            </p>

          <a href="https://vite-plugin-ssr.com">vite-plugin-ssr</a> - Like Next.js/Nuxt but as do-one-thing-do-it-well
          Vite plugin.
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              Vite-plugin-ssr also has first-class support for building framworks. It takes care of significantly more
              things than Vite's native SSR API: it enables you to build a framework like Next.js with only hundreds of
              lines of code.
            </p>
            <p>If you need more flexibility then use Vite's native SSR API instead.</p>
