      <p>Vike is a set of tools to easily:</p>

        <li>build your own app architecture, or</li>
        <li>build your own web framework.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hundreds of LOCs are enough to build a full-fledged architecture or framework.</p>

      <p>Vike tools:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://vite-plugin-ssr.com">vite-plugin-ssr</a> - Like Next.js/Nuxt but as do-one-thing-do-it-well

          Vite. (WIP.)

      <h2>Keep architectural control</h2>
      <p>
        Don't let a framework dictate your stack. With Vike, you keep full control: use any technology and tool you
        want.
      </p>

      <h2>Build your own framework</h2>
      <p>
        Build your own framework with only hundreds of LOCs: set up your architecture once, publish it as an npm
        package, then reap the benefits and re-use your framework for each new project.
      </p>

      <h2>All-included frameworks&#x2122;</h2>
      <p>
        While Next.js/Nuxt only takes care of the frontend, you can include all your integrations to your framework: the
        server (e.g. Express.js), authentication, communication (e.g. GraphQL or RPC), ORM (e.g. Prisma or MikroORM),
        logging (e.g. Prometheus), error tracking (e.g. Sentry), emailing (e.g. Mailgun + Nodemailer), deploy (e.g.
        Cloudflare Workers or AWS), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you've built your all-included framework, all it takes to create a new app is defining data models and UI
        components.
      </p>

      <h2>Scale your team</h2>
      <p>
        Give your senior colleagues the power of fully owning the architecture while providing your less-senior
        colleagues a simple framework that takes care of everything. Use and leverage your company's favorite tools
        without compromise.
      </p>

      <h2>Ecosystem of Frameworks</h2>
      <p>
        Vike fosters the creation of frameworks: use an all-included framework built by another company, fork and adjust
        it to your likings, and share your framework(s) with the world
        <span style="font-family: emoji">&#x2764;&#xFE0F;</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>Enhance your product</h2>
      <p>
        You are building a headless CMS? An e-commerce platform like Shopify? Delight your users with a tailored
        framework that deeply integrates with your product.
